	//testNG is:
	//1. java unit testing framework
	//in python: we have pytest, unittest
	//C#: Nunit
	//php: phpunit
	//JS: Jasmine, Mocha
	
	//multiple combinations:
	//selenium+ testing --> automation test Cases
	//api(RAssured) + testing
	//Appium (mobile) + testing
	
	//How o write manual test case:
	//1.global pre condition - annotations(@), (browser and web is launched)
	//2.pre condition - Annotations (user should be on the login page)
	//@Test
	//3.steps to reproduce (enetr user name and pass click onlogin) 
	//selenium steps
	//Assertations
	//4.act vs exp result (make sure user is successfully logged in)
	//post annotations
	//5.status --> pass/fail/skip 
	//6.test result --> HTML test report --> Extent report/ ALlure report
